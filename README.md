Website for typing speed/accuracy improvement.

## Learnings from project.
I created this website back when i was still learning more of the basics of programming and web development. Many of the ideas were found from tutorials but were later refactored as i got better.

Utilized a MySQL database for pulling random text strings for the user to type.
Basic login and registeration with database.
Unnecessarily fancy particle system for the background.
Major struggles with getting the string to be "typable" and representing the users progress in the DOM.

Attachment of how the site functioned:
